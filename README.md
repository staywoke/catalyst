## Tooling

This project is a fairly vanilla Ruby on Rails project. If you're not familiar with Ruby on Rails, we recommend reading one of the excellent introductory books.

If you are familiar with Ruby on Rails, we suggest looking at `config/routes.rb` for an overview of the non-standard way in which we're interacting with our Resources.

We're currently running:

 - Ruby 2.3.1
 - Rails 5.0.0
 - Postgres
 
Layouts and styling tooling includes:

 - Bootstrap
 - Sass
 - Haml (terser templating language)
 - SimpleForm

Authentication is handled through:

 - Devise

One of the most important gems we're using handles geocoding and location-based database queries:

- Geokit

Our testing tools include:

 - RSpec
 - FactoryGirl

## Modeling

## Deployment

Please talk to a project administrator to learn more about deployments. Short story is that we're running on Heroku.

## Contributing

We're building a crowd-sourcing platform to effect meaningful change in our communities. Obviously we're doing it with open-source software. We need your help!

If you'd like to contribute, please assign yourself to an Issue, create a branch, and then submit a pull request.
